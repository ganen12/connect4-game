This Connect Four Game Project is an implementation of the arcade game "Connect Four" using the C++ programming language. The game is played by two players, where they take turns placing checkers (such as 'X' or 'O') within the columns of the board. The goal is to reach four checkers connected to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

The main feature of this project involves the player's ability to be able to play against other players or against the computer. The option to select this game mode is available via the main menu.
